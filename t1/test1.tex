\maketitle
  \begin{abstract}
      For this assignment, we were tasked with approximating The Heat Equation, $u_t = u_{xx}, (0<x<1, t > 0)$ with given boundry conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$ and initial condition $u(x,0) = sin(\pi x)$ using methods dicussed in class. We were also asked to graph the exact soluition. 
 \end{abstract}
 \section{An Anylitical Solution}
    Using the method of \textit{Seperation of Variables}, the general solution the The Heat Equation with the given initial conditions and boundry conditions is
    \begin{equation}
        u(x,t) = e^{-(\pi)^2 t}sin(\pi x)
   \end{equation}

   below is a graph of $u(x,t)$ for $t = 0, .025, .1,\text{ and } .5$
   \section{A Computational Solution}
    The Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) scheme was used to appoximate the Solition to the PDE with MatLab. Below is a graph of the solition generated by this scheme.
